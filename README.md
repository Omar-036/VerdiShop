# Final Project - React + Vite

                                To run the project locally:

                            Run npm install to install dependencies.

                    Then run npm run dev to start the development server.

> âœ… I confirm that I completed the entire project by myself and did not seek help from anyone.  
> ðŸ•‘ I completed the assignment at 2 AM. I just need to deploy it on GitHub and submit it by 4 PM.

## ðŸš€ Tools Used

- **Vite** + **Tailwind CSS**
- I initially planned to use **Flowbite** for ready-made UI components, but I ended up not needing it.

## ðŸ“š Resources That Helped Me

- **DeepSeek**: Helped with the API context code, page designs, and other development parts.
- **React Udemy Course**: Assisted in understanding and implementing the API context.
- **YouTube**: Used tutorials to deploy the project on GitHub.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Focus

- Built a fully integrated project that covers all required features.
- Added enhancements such as a **username** feature.
- Focused on **responsive design** across different screen sizes.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

Some pages contain a large amount of code not related to functionality, but for design purposes.  
This is due to Tailwind CSS and the use of SVGs, which naturally result in many utility classes and long markup.
